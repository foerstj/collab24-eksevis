That diary you have. You say it warns you of the Blasted Goblin? F'hah! Good riddance to him, too -- ah, the Blasted Goblin, that is.

That is why I'm here -- that is why I have risked myself to be labeled kinslayer! In our home he had created some sort of cult around himself, and with my great mind... even I could not figure out why they would ever obey his likeness. Seems my friend was intending to take me away, but I have keen eyes.

Any how, my clan lives far away, much as the journal says, despite our species differences, I wish you the best of luck.

You may very well need it.";
